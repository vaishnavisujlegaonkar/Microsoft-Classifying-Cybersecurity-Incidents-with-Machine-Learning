# Microsoft-Classifying-Cybersecurity-Incidents-with-Machine-Learning



**Project Overview**

This project simulates a real-world data science scenario at Microsoft, where you're tasked with enhancing the effectiveness of Security Operation Centers (SOCs). The goal is to develop a machine learning classification model that can predict the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents using the comprehensive GUIDE dataset. The model classifies incidents as:

True Positive (TP)

Benign Positive (BP)

False Positive (FP)

The resulting system is intended to support guided response tools in prioritizing and triaging security alerts.

**Skills Gained**

Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Machine Learning Classification (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Model Evaluation (Macro-F1, Precision, Recall)

Handling Imbalanced Datasets

Hyperparameter Tuning & Cross-Validation

Feature Importance Analysis

 **Project Approach**
1.  Data Exploration
    a. Inspected structure, variable types, and class distribution

    b. Performed EDA using visualizations to understand trends and imbalances

2.  Data Preprocessing
    a. Handled missing values

    b. Applied feature engineering and transformations (e.g., datetime features)

    c. Encoded categorical features using One-Hot, Label, or Target Encoding

3.  Data Splitting
    a. Stratified train-validation split (80-20) to maintain class distribution

    b. Prepared a clean test.csv dataset for final evaluation

4.  Model Development
    a. Started with baseline models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree

    b. Trained advanced models: Random Forest, XGBoost

    c. Used class_weight='balanced' and stratified splits to handle class imbalance

    d. Performed RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

5.  Model Evaluation
    a. Evaluated models using:

    b. Macro-F1 Score

    c. Precision

    d. Recall

    e. Compared final model performance against baseline

6.  Feature Importance & Interpretation
    a. Computed Permutation Importance for feature insights

    b. Identified top 20 influential features

    c. Performed error analysis to identify common misclassifications

7.  Final Evaluation
    a. Final model trained using best parameters from tuning

    b. Evaluated on the full test dataset

    c. Achieved significant improvement over baseline metrics

ðŸ“Š Results
    a. Final Model: Tuned Random Forest Classifier with class_weight='balanced'
